# Smart Trash In Smart City

### Introduction:

Effective waste recycling is both economic and environmentally beneficial. It can 
help in recovering raw resources, preserving energy, mitigating greenhouse gaseous 
emission, water pollution, reducing new landfills. For that reason, we decide to use 
deep learning for building an automatic classification system for the waste item as 
either recyclable or not.


### Data Description:

metal, and trash. Where the original dataset consists of 2527 images, in this project.
